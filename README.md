###  Python Basics Course Repository

This repository contains my learning and practice work while completing a **Python Basics Course**.  
The goal of this repo is to demonstrate my understanding of **core Python concepts**, essential modules, and programming techniques.  

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 🔹 Python Fundamentals
- Variables, Data Types (int, float, string, list, dict, tuple, set)
- Conditional Statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`, nested loops)
- Functions (user-defined, built-in, lambda functions)
- Exception Handling (`try`, `except`, `finally`, `raise`)

### 🔹 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes & Objects
- Constructors (`__init__`)
- Methods (instance, class, static)
- Inheritance (single, multiple, multilevel)
- Encapsulation & Abstraction
- Polymorphism

### 🔹 Working with Modules
- **OS Module** → file & directory handling (create, delete, navigate)
- **Time Module** → delays, timestamps, formatting time
- **Requests Module** → HTTP requests, APIs, response handling
- **Math & Random Modules** → basic calculations & random number generation

### 🔹 Additional Concepts
- File Handling (read, write, append, JSON handling)
- Iterators & Generators
- List Comprehensions
- String Manipulation
- Error & Exception handling with custom exceptions

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sanskratipatel/PYTHON-BASIC.git
````

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd python-basics-course
   ```
3. Run any Python script:

   ```bash
   python filename.py
   ```

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

* Gained hands-on experience in **core Python programming**.
* Learned how to use **standard modules** like `os`, `time`, and `requests`.
* Built a strong foundation in **OOP principles**.
* Practiced error handling and writing clean, reusable code.

---

## 📌 Next Steps

* Explore **advanced Python topics** (decorators, context managers, async programming).
* Work on **mini-projects** using these concepts.
* Contribute to open-source Python projects to gain more experience.

Would you like me to also create a **shorter beginner-friendly version** (just highlights + run instructions), so you can use that if the detailed one feels too long?
```Here’s a clean and well-structured **README.md** you can use for your repo 👇
